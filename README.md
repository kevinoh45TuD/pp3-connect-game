## Introduction

This project was created using the language 'Python'. It is based on the real life game of the same name 'Connect 4'.

It has been deployed on Heroku using Code Institute's template to allow users to play it within their browser.

### Game Info

If the user picks option 2 on the start screen they will be shown this info screen. It provides basic information about the goal of Connect 4.
They will have the option to select any of the 3 options once more.

### Game

If the user picks option 1 a new game will start. The user will be show an empty connect board with the available options 1-7 above.
Selecting an option will drop a red token into this column, the computer will take a turn dropping a yellow token.

### End Game

Once a successful connection has been made the user will be brought to this end screen.
Selecting restart will start a fresh game, whereas quit will bring the user back to the start screen.

### Future Features

With a project like this many more features code be added, however the two main features I would focus on would be:
1. Game History: Some system to record previous matches the user has won or lost.
2. Player 2: It would be possible to allow the user to choose to play locally with a second player on the 1 computer, replacing the computer opponent.
